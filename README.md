# Laces2
This was my senior project: a mobile application that mixes social media with peer-to-peer sales for the designer-sneakers community. 
It was developed by myself, @Tito40, @Puzzle Angel, @ZMunson, @Brownie18, and Marcus Joseph at Kennesaw State University during our Spring 2017 semester. It was not completed.
